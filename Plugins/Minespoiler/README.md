# Minespoiler

Send games of minesweeper

## Usage

### Sending minesweeper games

#### Just minesweeper

If you just want to send the game of minesweeper you can send a message with the content
`minesweeper:<width> <height> <bombCount>`<br>
**Example:** `minesweeper:17 8 20`

#### Inside a message

If you want to include the game into a message you can send a message with the content

```
minesweeper:<width> <height> <bombCount> here some text
%GAME%
here some other text that is below the game
```

There is no linebreak in front of or behind the game so you should add it by yourself

### Playing minesweeper

There are some tweaks for playing minesweeper, but they are only possible for people who have this plugin.<br>

- With this plugin you can actually right click a field to mark it as a bomb.
- When you click a field that is a :zero: it will automatically reveal all fields next to it
- When you finished revealing all fields without a bomb all bombs will get flagged
- When you click a bomb all fields get revealed
- There is an information about how many bombs are left
- If you win or fail there is a retry button
